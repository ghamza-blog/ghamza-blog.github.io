In this series, we'll see how rust works on Android and ios. We will start with setting up the project.

To build for android and iOS, you should be on macOS. If you're using windows, you can only build for android, but worth noting that some commands and setups might be different (for example, you might not have `make`, `python`, or `brew` on your machine)

You can use the development environment you're most comfortable with, but mine is [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (thinking of moving to [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) ðŸ¤“) with these extensions:

- [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)
- [Better TOML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bungcip.better-toml)
- [CodeLLDB](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb)

I also use [Fig](https://fig.io/) to get suggestions on the terminal.

## Creating the project

1. We're not going to use `cargo new --lib` yet; instead, we're going to create an empty directory.

    ```shell
    mkdir greeting-lib
    cd greeting-lib
    ```

2. Then inside of it, we want `Cargo.toml`, `.gitignore`, `Makefile`, and `src/`.

    ```shell
    touch Cargo.toml .gitignore Makefile
    mkdir src
    ```

    `Cargo.toml` will contain our rust workspace members, and inside `Makefile` we will put our commands.

3. Add ignore patterns

    ```txt
    # Generated by Cargo
    # will have compiled files and executables
    debug/
    target/

    # These are backup files generated by rustfmt
    **/*.rs.bk

    # MSVC Windows builds of rustc generate these, which store debugging information
    *.pdb

    .DS_Store

    # Editors
    .idea/
    .fleet/
    .vscode/

    main.rs
    ```

    I usually ignore `main.rs` for libs so I can keep it locally as a playground without having my draft code on the repo

4. And finally, initialize git.

    ```shell
    git init
    ```

## Creating Rust Libraries

Now we're going to create three rust libraries

```shell
cargo new --lib src/greeting_core
cargo new --lib src/android_glue
cargo new --lib src/ios_glue
```

Then the rust analyzer will go mad, so let us add them to the workspace inside the `Cargo.toml` on the root directory.

```toml
[workspace]
members = [
    "src/android_glue",
    "src/ios_glue",
    "src/greeting_core"
]
```

## Makefile

Inside it, we're going to add some commands to make our life easier for the setup and building.

```make
ios_targets = aarch64-apple-ios x86_64-apple-ios aarch64-apple-ios-sim
android_targets = armv7-linux-androideabi i686-linux-android aarch64-linux-android x86_64-linux-android
lib_name = greeting

android-setup:
 @for target in ${android_targets} ; do \
  rustup target add $$target ; \
 done

ios-setup:
 cargo install cargo-lipo

 @for target in ${ios_targets} ; do \
  rustup target add $$target ; \
 done
```

In other parts of this series, we will add more commands to this file.

## Install Android and iOS Targets

In the previous step, we added commands to setup both Android and iOS, so now let us run them

```shell
make android-setup
make ios-setup
```

## Add Minimal Code Inside Core

Inside `src/greeting_core/src/lib.rs` replace the file's content with a simple greeting function

```rust
pub fn greet(person: &str) -> String {
    format!("Hello {person}")
}
```

And you've reached the end of the first part ðŸ¦€.

In the next part, we will start gluing rust code with iOS and create a sample app.
