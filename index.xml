So people used different methods to ease the knowledge transfer.
Let us look at different types of representing data and how it could affect usage of it. We will learn Morse code in this article!
Morse code is a communication method invented by Samuel Morse. It&amp;rsquo;s based on short and long signals. If you want to communicate with someone using light, you can turn on the light for 1 second and turn it off to show him it&amp;rsquo;s a short signal and 3 seconds for long signals.</description></item><item><title>Number Bases</title><link>https://blog.ghamza.dev/posts/number-bases/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 01:00:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://blog.ghamza.dev/posts/number-bases/</guid><description>Old number systems Most historians believe that numbers were originally invented to count things, such as people, possessions, and transactions in commerce. For example, if someone owned three apples, it was written as drawings of three apples üçéüçéüçé
The person whose job it was to draw the apples and other things thought, &amp;ldquo;Why do I have to draw the same thing multiple times? Why can&amp;rsquo;t I draw it once and indicate that there are several of them with, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, a scratch mark or something?</description></item><item><title>Computer Memory</title><link>https://blog.ghamza.dev/posts/computer-memory/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Sep 2021 01:00:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://blog.ghamza.dev/posts/computer-memory/</guid><description>Usually in computers data are stored in 3 different types of memories, nonvolatile memory (or NVM for short), volatile memory, and processor memory. Think of the application&amp;rsquo;s data as a book, in fact, data in memory are distributed in a page-like model.
NVM has the capacity of storing a large amount of data, so we see computers or external storage have capacities of 500 GB, 1 TB, 2 TB, and even more.</description></item><item><title>Computer Compression</title><link>https://blog.ghamza.dev/posts/computer-compression/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Aug 2021 01:00:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://blog.ghamza.dev/posts/computer-compression/</guid><description>Compression isn&amp;rsquo;t something new, people used to compress things even before computers, folding-papers for example, so if you have a piece of paper containing some information or data, you can&amp;rsquo;t keep it in its flat state, so to make it mobile you have to fold it, to reduce its size so that it can be carried easily.
However, compression has its disadvantages as well, when something is compressed it becomes &amp;ldquo;unreadable&amp;rdquo;, so if you fold a paper it&amp;rsquo;s no longer readable.</description></item></channel></rss>
